# Network Interpreter
### Shea Clark-Tieche, Siddhartha Prasad, and Nikhil Shinday

*uScheme* is a language detailed in the book *Programming Languages: an
Interpreter-Based Approach* by Ramsey and Kamin. This repository/directory
contains a *uScheme* interpreter that can be used by several clients across
a network. All clients share an environment, and need to be connected to the
parent server to access it. A graceful exit runs the interpreter locally with
the shared environment.

While this program uses a *uScheme* interpreter, and has some language specific
features, the server and client are interpreter agnostic in a general sense.

More details can be found in the [System wiki](https://github.com/sidprasad/NetworkInterpreter/wiki).
