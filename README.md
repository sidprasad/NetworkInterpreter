# Network Interpreter
### Shea Clark-Tieche, Siddhartha Prasad, and Nikhil Shinday

*uScheme* is a language detailed in the book *Programming Languages: an
Interpreter-Based Approach* by Ramsey and Kamin. This repository/directory
contains a *uScheme* interpreter that can be used by several clients across
a network. All clients share an environment, and need to be connected to the
parent server to access it. A graceful exit allows creates a local copy
of the interpreter with this environment.

While this program uses a *uScheme* interpreter, and has some language specific
features, the server and client are interpreter agnostic in a general sense.

## Current Protocol

When the server communicates with the client (and vice versa), we have the
following basic protocol.

Message Type   | From  | To   | Meaning|
---------------|-------|------|--------
1              |Client |Server|Request to connect|
2              |Server |Client|Update to environment|
3              |Client |Server|Interpreter command|
4              |Server |Client|Interpreter command ACK |
5              |Client |Server|Graceful exit|
6              |Server |Client| Interpreter file transfer|
7              |Server |Client| logfile transfer|
8              |Server |Client| Accepted connection|


A graceful exit provides the user with a copy of the interpreter as
well as a log with all the commands provided to the interpreter.
This can be used by a client to create an offline interpreter with the
same current environment.


## Usage

### Client

    sh ccompile
    
    or

    gcc -g iclient.c -o ni_client -lnsl -pthread
    ./ni_client <hostname> <portnumber>


The command  *(exit)* can be used to transfer from a network to local interpreter.

### Server

    gcc -g iserv.c -o server -lnsl
    ./server <portnumber>

## Misc

- The files *logfile.scm* and *intermediate* are generated by the server.
No files with these names should be in the same directory as the server.

- On the client-side, the file names *uscheme1* and *logfile.scm* are reserved.


## Future Plans

- Implementing a graceful transfer to a local interpreter on unplanned disconnection.
