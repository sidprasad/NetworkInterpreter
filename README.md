#Networks - Comp 112 Final Project
### Shea Clark-Tieche, Siddhartha Prasad, and Nikhil Shinday

10th April 2015

This repository/directory contains a *uScheme* interpreter that can be used by
several clients across a network. All clients share an environment, and need to
 be connected to the parent server to access it.

    Github repository: https://github.com/sidprasad/NetworkingInterpreter

## Tasks

- Nikhil: Graceful disconnect file transfer

- Shea: 

- Siddhartha: 

## Current Issues

- Currently using intermediate files for interprocess communication
- Need to implement bad disconnect

## Current Protocol

When the server communicates with the client (and vice versa), we have the
following basic protocol.

Message Type   | From  | To   | Meaning|
---------------|-------|------|--------
1              |Client |Server|Request to connect|
2              |Server |Client|Update to environment|
3              |Client |Server|Interpreter command|
4              |Server |Client|Interpreter command ACK |
5              |Client |Server|Graceful exit|
6              |Server |Client| Interpreter file|
7              |Server |Client| logfile|
8              |Server |Client| Accepted connection|


A graceful exit provides the user with a copy of the interpreter as
well as a log with all the commands provided to the interpreter.
This can be used by a client to create an offline interpreter with the
same current environment.

## Future Plans

- Possibly distributed system
- Local environment

## Usage

Client

    sh ccompile
    
    or

    gcc -g acklessclient.c -o ack -lnsl -pthread
    ./ack <hostname> <portnumber>

Server

    gcc -g iserv.c -o server -lnsl
    ./server <portnumber>

The files *logfile.scm* and *intermediate* are generated by the server.
No files with these names should be in the same directory as the server.
